# G-Functions
Thermodynamic Equilibrium

These two python scripts create a dataframe (Phase Diagram) of all the points plotted in both figures (G-Functions).
The heat capacity equation was manipulated from the Pb-Sn phase diagram from a professor of mine.
The original equation didn't have the ideal values to prove the point. 
The scripts don't use any analytical calulations as was Gibbs' original intent, because the dataframe has all the necessary information.
